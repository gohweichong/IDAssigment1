        <p class="right2_about">Since 1860, Tag Heuer was founded in Switzerland by Edward Heuer. He started as an
            apprentice of a watchmaker at the age of 14. Since then he was able to set-up his own
            watch shop. His ideas and designs for watches become more famous, creating watches
            no one has ever seen. Till now, the Heuer family passess down the company to the next 
            generation to its current CEO, Jackson Heuer. Keeping the idea of taking watchmaking
            to new levels of accuracy and performance with our moto "Swiss Avant-Garde Since 1860".

        <h3 class="pr_about">Today, our ambassadors reflect our mindset, our taste for challenge, and the ability to surpass oneself.
            #DontCrackUnderPressure is much more than a claim: it is a state of mind. “Don’t Crack Under Pressure” is intended to focus 
            on a more youthful demographic, and sources indicate that TAG Heuer will return a bit more to “affordable” watches in some of the price ranges it was more known for in the 1990s.</h3>
