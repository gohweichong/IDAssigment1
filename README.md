# Tag Heuer Website
I created a website about Tag Heuer, a luxury watch company that is known worldwide. However, I am making a website about the backstory of Tag Heuer and what they strive to be. The site's users are mainly old or new customers who wish to learn more about the history of Tag Heuer, the sponsors and awards Tag Heuer has achieved and more insight on the people Tag Heuer work with. 

As the sight owner, I am trying to interest people into wanting to buy the Tag Heuer watches by showing them Tag Heuer's long history and the awards Tag Heuer has gotten. The website will also attract customers by showing customers their favourite celebrities that wear or work with Tag Heuer. With this, I will be able to sell the more watches and get more customers to keep on buying our watches.

# Design Process(Wireframe)
Heading Menu: All pages of the website will start of with a header menu that show all five web pages. Home, About, Feats, Contact Us and an image of a magnifying glass that will represent the search page. There will also be the Tag Heuer logo at the top left to always indicate the website of the company.

Home Page: As a customer, I want to buy a watch from a brand that exudes luxury. Thus I created a design with a slick black background, so that the whole website looks more mysterious, mature and luxurious. The customers would also want to know how the Tag Heuer watches look like, so I made sure that the home page would show the a good picture of a good pile of watches to attract customers based on the looks of the luxurious watches. I also added a phrase saying "Pushing The Limits of Watches to Greater Heights Since 1860" to impress customers or draw them in because of how long Tag Heuer has been created. A video is right below the screen to show the newest watch that Tagheuer is selling, this is a quick way to pull in customers who want a good look at our watches.

About Page: As a customer, I would like to know more about the Tag Heuer in this page. The about page is then started with a heading that says About and a photo of another watch in it. The page is about the history of the founder and how he started the Tag Heuer business. Adding on I add on the hashtag that our company promotes "#DontCrackUnderPressure" to show customers our work mindset when it comes to Tag Heuer, and I add on a photo of a man doing a rigorous task but trying hard to struggle through. This photo will emphasize the mindset of #DontCrackUnderPressure and will help relay our message even better. Through these methods, the customer would have a good understanding of how the company came about and be impressed with the company's goals.

Feats Page: This page mainly consists of the awards and achievements the Tag Heuer has made. As a customer, I would want to be shown with what Tag Heuer has to offer for feats, so I greet the customers on the page of the several awards Tag Heuer has obtained throughout the years. This way, customers would be impressed over what Tag Heuer has accomplished. Not only that, I would also like to see what kind of people wear this Tag Heuer brand, so I show them the sponsors that Tag Heuer has had to have them get good photoshoots of famous people wearing the watches. This would really show customers that even famous celebrities and actors wear this brand of watches, making customers want to be like their favourite celebrities and buy them too.

Contact Us Page: As a customer, I would want the page to be a clear cut of how to follow Tag Heuer on other online platforms. Thus, I created the page with a simple photo of the Tag Heuer building to show how luxurious the building looks like and all the icons of other social media websites to follow Tag Heuer such as Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and LinkedIn. This way, customers would have instant access to all the Tag Heuer accounts on different platforms and follow them.

Search Page: After all these pages, customers may want to go buy our watches. Thus I created another page with a magnifying glass image for a search page to allow customers to go search and buy for watches. I made the magnifying glass at the right side of the website so that customers have a clear view of what to press on for them to search for watches. Even though the customers want a watch, new customers may not know what watch to buy. Hence, I made a section in the search page called recommended. That way, customers may know what kind of watches are deemed better and have a better decision when buying watches. 

## Features
- Feature 1 - Allows users to have a more interesting experience when tapping on the menu, by having a transform feature in CSS to allow the background colour of the box the mouse is hovering to change colour.

- Feature 2 - Allows users to be able to use this website on the phone, by using media feature in CSS to change the format of the website to fit in a phone screen when the screen size is different.

- Feature 3 - Allows users to be able to search for watches by creating a form feature so that customers could search for a type of phone and press the button feature to search for it.

- Features 4 - Allows users to follow Tag Heuer on other platforms, by adding a link to each of the images in Contact Us which leads them straight to the Tag Heuer account of any of the websites mentioned on the page. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- (These two are the only languages used to make this website)
- Visual Studio Code - This app is what I used to write my HTML and CSS code

# Testing
### Validation and Code Checks
1. The HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues
2.the CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues

### Non-automated pages
1. Search form:
    1. Go to the image of the magnifying glass that leads to the "Search Page"
    2. Try to enter a watch type you want to find and watch name is not there, the search will say "Watch Not Found"
    3. Try to enter a watch type you want to find and watch name is there, the search will lead to that specific watch you wanted or the watches that consist of the words searched for
  
### Test on Phone size:
So the media feature is activated once the width of the webpage is less than 600px. 
So once the page is leser than 600px, the following changes will occur:
Header Menu: The menu will become more compact but will still be able to fit all the words and contents on top nicely.

Home Page: The heading title will be centred as the screen gets smaller and the image of the watches will become smaller and be below the title a bit more to take up more space.

About Page: The photo of the title and the watch will be centred at the top of the page, followed by the title founder and the photo of the founder of Tag Heuer below it. Now the text about the history of the founder is then switched to below the photo instead of beside him where the text was originally. The image of the man doing a vigourous task is then smaller but the text beside is not change and is still fitted well in the website so that all users can still read the text well.

Feats Page: Firstly, the wide image of a Tag Heuer shop is taken out due to the width being too large. The image of the award and the watch that won that made Tag Heuer win the award is compacted together but still nicely place to show both images. The text is still below the images but longer due to lesser width. The image of Chris Hemsworth and Leonardo Dicaprio is above the paragraph of text about patrons now instead of beside it which is the normal position in a larger screen. The text is just under the images of the celebrities due to lack of space.

Contact Page: The wide image of a Tag Heuer building is taken out due to the width being too large. The page just shows the Folow Us text with the images of each link placed differently which is more vertically instead of horizontally to accomodate for the lesser width of the screen.

Search Page: The search text and the search bar is centres as the screen is smaller. The recommended watches are placed more vertically instead of horizontally to accomodate for the lesser width of the screen.
